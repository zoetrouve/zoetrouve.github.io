<p> Hi, My name is Zoé and I am a senior at Georgetown University living and working in my townhome in Georgetown. I have had much more time to cook this past year given the pandemic. Thus, I have collected my favorite recipes and organized them into a simple webpage to be accessed quickly and easily.</p>

<p> My go-to breakfast is an oatmeal I have perfected over the course of this year. I have eaten various versions of this oatmeal almost every day. I start with boiling 1 cup of water on the stove. As the water is boiling, I dice a small apple into half-inch cubes. When the water reaches boiling, I add the apple to the pot along with a half-cup of dry oats. Then, I add a couple shakes of cinnamon and a handful of frozen blueberries. I let it sit and stir occasionally to make sure all the flavors meld together beautifully. </p>

<p>Lunch during the week is whatever can be rapidly put together in the short time I have between classes. A lot of times, I reheat previous dinners or I will meal-prep for the week. One of my favorite go-to recipes is a Mediterranean Quinoa Salad from an Instagram influencer I follow. I find this refreshing recipe easy to make and very filling. To top it off, it's vegetarian too!</p>

<h1 class="heading">Dinner</h1>
<p> Dinner for me growing up was the classic French family meal. Two hours long and just sitting and chatting with my siblings and parents. My mom is a wonderful chef and always cooked incredible dinners. This past year I have been more intentional than ever about learning some tips and tricks from the queen herself. I found out about this specific recipe from one of my roomates who has cooked it a lot. I made it for my Mom over winterbreak and it was #momapproved. This Shakshuka can be a classic breakfast (or in my case, dinner) dish that pairs well with eggs and feta as optional add-ins. This easy, quick recipe will feed your stomach for days to come. You can even change up how it's prepared as left-overs such as in an omelet or on top of a bed of lettuce. You will not be disappointed.</p>

<h1 class="heading">Dessert</h1>
<p> Baking has always been a favorite past-time of mine. I do not get to bake as often as I would like when I am at school so whenever I am home I never pass up the opportunity. This time of year, I absolutely love making homemade Easter cookies. They are just simple sugar cookie base and royal icing frosting but they are so delicious and so easy to make. I have worked on my decorating skills, especially since the start of college, and believe that this past year was a high point for my Easter cookies. I cannot wait to see what this coming year has to bring to the table (in terms of my decorating skills of course). </p>
